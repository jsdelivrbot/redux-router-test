Concept questions / not nit picky



- History: JS package that manages URL of browser. Watches for changes and can update it.
  - History takes URL and gives it to ReactRouter


- ReactRouter
  - The RR will change the components on the page based on the URL it's given
    - Emulating a user navigating a different web page. User thinks they changed pages      
      entirely.  



- Will have state that is array of posts and then state that is show action/individual post


reduxForm has same behavior as connect, so we can use it to inject action creators into our components and create a container out of component
